One of the many ways LoopBack 4 allows for extensibility is through Components.
A Component makes it easy for independent developers to contribute additional
features to LoopBack. Components provide a package that allows you to extend
your Application.

A typical LoopBack component is an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package
exporting a Component class whih can be added to your application.

```ts
import { RestApplication } from "@loopback/rest";
import { AuthenticationComponent } from "@loopback/authentication";

const app = new RestApplication();
// Add component to Application, which provides bindings used to resolve
// authenticated requests in a Sequence.
app.component(AuthenticationComponent);
```

Components can contribute the following items:

* [Controllers](Controllers.html)
* Providers of additional [Context values](Context.html)

LoopBack 4 was built with extensibility in mind and this includes Components,
which can be allowed to contribute additional artifacts by adding a Mixin
to your Application class. This doesn't change how a a Component is registered
(`app.component()`) but it enables the Component to contribute additional artifacts.
For example:

* `RepositoryMixin` from `@loopback/repository` enables a Component to
  contribute [Repositories](Repositories.html)
* `BootMixin` from `@loopback/boot` enables a Component to
  contribute [Booters](Booting-an-Application.html#booters)

**Note:** Always check a components instructions to see if it requires
the use of a Mixin. A Mixin may autoamtically register a Component, saving you
the trouble of having to do so manually. Again it's best to check the documentation
for the given Component / Mixin.
